#Style Transfer Using TensorFlow and VGG19
This project implements neural style transfer using TensorFlow and the pre-trained VGG19 model. The technique blends the content of one image with the artistic style of another, creating a unique, stylized output. The script processes and combines the images, leveraging the VGG19 model's layers to extract and merge content and style features effectively. The resulting image showcases the structure of the content image imbued with the visual characteristics of the style image.

Usage
To run the style transfer, ensure you have the required packages installed (TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy), then execute the script. The input images (content and style) should be placed in the specified directory, and the output will be saved in the same location.

This brief setup allows for straightforward execution and modification, making it easy to apply neural style transfer to any pair of images.
